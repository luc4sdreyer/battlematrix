This is my entry for the 2013 Entelect R100K challenge: a programming competition where each contestant had to write an AI bot for a game that resembles the classic Battle City on NES.

This project can:

  - Connect to a host to play the game as definied by the competition rules.
  - Visualize a realtime local game between two bots.
  - Simulate games to test and compare bots.

Using this project for anything else might lead to insanity, or something much worse like  a quantum vacuum metastability event. You have been warned.
